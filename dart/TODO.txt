TODO items for the Dart benchmark:

1. Modify the framework benchmark installer to install Dart.  I think the URL is: https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-editor-archive-integration/latest/darteditor-linux-64.zip

2. Modify setup.py to run multiple dart servers behind nginx as a load balancer.  See server.dart's "main" function for command line options for choosing a port and connection pool size.

3. Modify benchmark_config to have the correct "sort" number.

4. See if any Dart experts are willing to give this a code review.
